#README##Sudoku Solver and Sudoku Game GUIIn this repository there are multiple different files. The file named __GUI.py__ is a GUI that is a Sudoku game, which calls functions that can be found in __sudoku.py__. The file labeled  __sudokuSolver.py__ is a separate script that solves sudoku problems for you, and displays the solved and unsolved boards. Finally, the file named __fonts.py__ is simply a tool for you to use to see which fonts you have installed, so you can change up the code in the GUI and make it your own. ##InstallationIn order to use the GUI you will need to have both python and pygame installed. You can follow the instructions from this [link](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted), which will lead you to the __pygame__ website, and you can follow the instructions from this [link](https://www.python.org/) which will take you to the __python__ website.##UsageIn order to use the scripts and the GUI, you will have to enter in all of the numbers for your sudoku puzzle. __NOTE:__ You must enter the sudoku puzzle from left to right, as if you were reading a book. This is a long process, but for both the GUI, and the sudokuSolver script, the board will be displayed after you enter all of the numbers.__NOTE:__ Empty spaces must be entered as zeroes.
